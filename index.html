          <p>One Tree Hill is an American drama television series created by Mark Schwahn, which premiered on September
            23, 2003, on The WB.[1] After the series' third season, The WB merged with UPN to form The CW, and from
            September 27, 2006, the series was broadcast by The CW in the United States until the end of its run in
            2012. The show is set in the fictional town of Tree Hill in North Carolina and initially follows the lives
            of two half-brothers, Lucas Scott (Chad Michael Murray) and Nathan Scott (James Lafferty), who compete for
            positions on their school's basketball team, and the drama that ensues from the brothers' romances.

            Most of the filming took place in and around Wilmington, North Carolina. Many of the scenes were shot near
            the battleship USS North Carolina and on the University of North Carolina Wilmington campus. Writers used a
            semi-floating timeline for the first four seasons, so that the issues depicted are modern for the viewers.
            Within these seasons we see the characters build unexpected relationships as they face the challenges of
            growing up in a small town. However, at the beginning of the fifth season, Schwahn advanced the timeline by
            four years to show their lives after college. This season featured a new storyline supported by flashbacks
            to their college years. Later, Schwahn made it jump a further fourteen months from the end of the sixth to
            the start of the seventh season.[2] The opening credits were originally accompanied by the song "I Don't
            Want to Be" by Gavin DeGraw. The theme was removed from the opening in the fifth season; Schwahn said that
            this was to lower production costs, to add more time for the storyline, and because he felt that the song
            was more representative of the core characters' adolescent past than their present maturity.[3] The credits
            then consisted only of the title written on a black background. The theme was restored for season 8, in
            response to audience demand, and was sung by different artists each week.

            The series premiered to 2.5 million viewers and rose to 3.3 million in its second week, becoming one of only
            three shows to rise in their second episode during the 2003–2004 television season. Season one went on to
            average 3.5 million viewers, and the second season was the highest rated in the series, averaging 4.3
            million viewers weekly and a 1.9 Adults 18–49 rating.[4] The series received numerous award nominations,
            winning two Teen Choice Awards.

            On May 12, 2009, it was confirmed that Murray and Hilarie Burton (Peyton) had declined to return for the
            seventh season, although accounts of what transpired vary. Their characters (Lucas and Peyton) had been two
            of the five main protagonists, and had provided one of its central love stories, throughout the
            show.[5][6][7] On May 17, 2011, The CW renewed One Tree Hill for a ninth[8] and final season, placing an
            order for 13 episodes.[9] Bethany Joy Lenz (Haley) and Sophia Bush (Brooke) were signed as full-time
            regulars for one final season,[10] and Lafferty appeared as a part-time regular.[11] Murray returned for a
            special appearance during the final season,[12] which premiered on January 11, 2012.[13] The show is the
            fourth-longest-running series on The CW network, or the networks that came together to make it up (The WB
            and UPN), after Smallville, 7th Heaven, and Supernatural. The series concluded on April 4, 2012.</p>.

          <h2>is one tree hill worth to watch ? </h2> <br> <br>
        <div>OTH is the best teen drama imo if that’s your type of genre. It really does get better after the pilot

          For the seasons:
          
          s1-s4 = r the best ever and has somewhat a perfect ending to the show if it didn’t continue
          
          s5 = still a good season but definitely can’t be compared to the earlier seasons and some storylines definitely become so annoying to some characters
          
          s6 = great season and it’s the only season where no main character from the core 5 became annoying throughout and it’s also the real ending of OTH at least for me.
          
          s7-s9 = it definitely felt more like a spin off because of some real changes that occurred. The storylines did become messy and boring at times though that it took me months to finish. But one main character did shine on these seasons according to some people and that character became pretty much the most lovable character to most OTH fans
          
          When rewatching the show i pretty much only do s1-s6 and i’m somewhat already satisfied..</div>
